    </h2>
    <p>
        This chicken Cordon Bleu casserole is everything you want from a chicken Cordon Bleu, 
        but with way less effort. All the flavor is there in a version you can whip up on a weeknight, 
        and easily scale to serve more people. How great is it when the easiest way to make a classic 
        turns out to also be the best way?

        <li>1/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chicken</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large skinless, boneless chicken breast (about 8 ounces)</li>

        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>1 pinch fresh thyme leaves</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>

        <li>1 rounded teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>

        <li>1 ounce diced smoked ham</li>

        <li>1 ounce Gruyere cheese, grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>For topping, place panko in a small bowl; add in butter, Parmesan, and season with pepper. Stir together until evenly combined and mixture resembles coarse sand; set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut  chicken into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer into a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, cayenne, thyme, and salt. Add cream, Dijon, ham, and 2/3 of the grated Gruyere. Stir to combine, and transfer into a small baking dish. Top evenly with remaining 1/3 of the cheese, </li>
        <li>Spoon crumb mixture evenly over the top. Poke crumbs down lightly into the chicken mixture with the tip of the spoon before evening out the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through, the casserole is bubbling around the edges, and the top is nicely browned, about 25 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
