# odin-recipies
First project from The Odin project

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

There is an index page which contains relative links to 3 pages:
    Rosemary Lemon Grilled Chicken
    Honey Mustard Chicken Wings
    Chicken Cordon Bleu Casserole for One

Added photo, description, ingredients, directions and any other necessary elements.

Finalised the website with html for now. Will update later.
