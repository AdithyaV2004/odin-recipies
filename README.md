First project from The Odin project

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. Planning to develop further

There is an index page which contains relative links to 3 pages:
    Rosemary Lemon Grilled Chicken
    Honey Mustard Chicken Wings
    Chicken Cordon Bleu Casserole for One

Added photo, description, ingredients, directions and any other necessary elements.

Finalised the website with html for now. Will update later.
